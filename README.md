# Book-Recommendations
## Project Description
Recommendation systems are at the heart of many products such as Netflix or Amazon. They generally rely on metadata (e.g., the actors or director of a movie) or on user tastes (e.g., the movies you liked before) to determine which you are most likely to enjoy. But when you are working with text-heavy datasets, you have access to a much richer resourceâ€”the whole text! In this project, i will build a book recommendation system based on their content. i will use Charles Darwin's bibliography to find out which books might interest you. In this notebook, we will automatically detect how closely related Charles Darwin books are to each other.

To this purpose, i will develop the bases of a content-based book recommendation system, which will determine which books are close to each other based on how similar the discussed topics are
